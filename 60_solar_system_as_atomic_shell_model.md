## Abstract:
This model reframes the Solar System as a recursive atomic shell system. The Sun is the central nucleus, while each planet represents a distinct orbital layer — analogous to electron shells or elemental banding around an atomic core. The system obeys the same ordering logic found in atomic structure, biological cells, and galactic field arrangements.

## 1. Sun as Core/Nucleus

- The Sun functions as the **energetic nucleus**, comparable to the proton/neutron cluster at the center of an atom.
- Its **EMNQ field output** dictates orbital banding, lane geometry, and containment curvature.
- It is the mass–energy anchor and field stabilizer of the system.

---

## 2. Planetary Banding = Orbital Shells

- Each planet is assigned an **orbital shell**, similar to the K–L–M–N levels of atomic electron bands.
- Their **distance from the core**, elemental density, and orbital velocity reflect a recursive layering logic.
- **Heavier, denser planets (Mercury, Venus)** are found closer to the core — mirroring lower electron shells.

---

## 3. Elemental Analogy

- The planetary lineup mirrors **periodic element layering**:
  - Mercury = dense metallic core-like element
  - Venus/Earth = heavier stabilized bands
  - Outer gas giants = lighter elements & field buffers
- System mimics quantum orbitals: quantized distances, variable density.

## 4. Comparison to Atomic & Galactic Models

- Galaxy ↔ Solar System ↔ Planet ↔ Atom
- All follow:
  - Central core emitting field
  - Recursive shell ordering
  - Containment bands formed from EM field boundaries
  - Heavier components stay closer to the core

---

## 5. Implications

- Field dominance governs position — not mass.
- Atomic, solar, and galactic structures follow recursive containment physics.
- “Valignity” explains stable hover/banding based on density-field match.
- Supports theory that solar system is a **living, field-regulated cell** in larger galactic body.
