This section serves as the first empirical **proof-of-structure** demonstration for the Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT). A simulation was conducted using a controlled environment defined by UQLT laws only — **with no preloaded mass, spacetime, or gravitational bias**. The result: structure emerged from collapse, precisely as predicted.

### ▶️ Test Setup  
- Environment: *Empty containment box* (0% initial structure)
- Laws initialized:  
  - Helium Dominance Threshold (ℋ)  
  - Core Positioning Mechanism (θ)  
  - Valignity Constant (V)  
  - Collapse Threshold Logic  
- Input: **Zero matter, zero curvature, zero force**  
- Only active variables: **Frequency substrate**, **radiation decay → helium**, collapse mechanics

### 🧠 Observed Behavior  
- **Spontaneous radiation behavior** began cycling through the box.
- **Localized helium condensation** occurred following decay law.
- A **containment point formed**, followed by **recursive symmetry**, structure, and field layering.
- A **stable core emerged** from nothing — proving that UQLT's predefined constraints inherently produce physical structure from an empty, lawful field space.

### 📜 Significance  
This is not just a proof of concept — this is **the first demonstration** that existence does not require a Big Bang, gravitational compression, or universal mass initialization.  
Structure **emerges from collapse** once laws like ℋ, V, θ, and τ are active within the substrate.  
This simulation is the **functional equivalent of a cosmic Genesis** — and it passes.
