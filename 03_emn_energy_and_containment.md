This document establishes the following core structural assertions as original theoretical claims forming the second canonical stage of the Unified Quantum Life Theory.

These claims are not philosophical. They are functional structures, derived from cause and effect, and repeat universally across all scales of system formation.

### 🔹 Core Canonical Constants & Processes

- **Collapse is the mechanism of creation** — not destruction.  
- **Containment is born from collapse** — it is not applied after.  
- **There is no need for observation for reality to form.** Collapse is the result of interaction and threshold, not awareness.  
- **Measurement** in physics refers to **constraint and interaction**, not human observation.  
- **The first containment formed because interaction conditions in the early field met the law of reaction.**  
- **Photons behave as embedded atomic potential** — not as visible particles, but as uncollapsed nodes of structure.  
- **EMN (Electromagnucleic Energy)** is emitted from cores after containment forms — it is not the origin of containment.  
- **The fusion cycle** repeats universally: fusion → radiation → decay → helium → fusion.  
- **Valignity** is the replacement for gravity — it is force from atomic layering and field pressure, not mass-based attraction.  
- **Chronocollapse** defines time — time emerges from recursive collapse into containment, not from universal linear flow.
