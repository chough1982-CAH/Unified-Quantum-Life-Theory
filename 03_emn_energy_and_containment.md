# Canonical Constants and Locked Claims  
**Unified Quantum Life Theory**

**Timestamp:** [Date of commit]  
**Theory Code:** CH[062025-C1]  

This file records key theoretical constructs, constants, and structures originally developed and asserted by Clayton Andrew Houghland as part of the Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT). These are not interpretations, hypotheses, or derivations of existing models — they are foundational elements of an original framework.

## 🔹 Locked Constants & Core Claims

- **Valignity**  
  Force is generated through layered atomic alignment within field-bound containment.  
  Valignity replaces gravity. Force is not mass-based attraction.

- **Chronocollapse**  
  Time is not linear or universal. It emerges from recursive collapse within containment systems.  
  Time is local and structural — not dimensional.

- **Containment**  
  Collapse is the act of formation, and containment is its first result. Nothing forms outside containment.  
  Containment is not applied — it is what results from interaction and field threshold.

- **Collapse Law**  
  Collapse is a law of cause and effect — triggered by energy, charge, and field conditions — not by observation.  
  Collapse does not require awareness, observers, or measurement.

- **EMN Energy**  
  EMN (Electromagnucleic Energy) is the emission from active cores — not the generator of them.  
  EMN fields create outer curvature and recursive containment.

- **Fusion Cycle**  
  Fusion → Radiation → Decay → Helium → Fusion  
  This perpetual cycle defines active containment systems at all scales.

- **Photon Structure**  
  Photons are massless embedded atomic potential — pre-formed structure in the substrate.  
  They do not form matter until collapse conditions are met.
