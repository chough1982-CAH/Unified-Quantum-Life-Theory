## Core Architecture of Formation

In Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT), structure forms through recursive containment — not gravitational orbit.

The black hole emits a toroidal field structure that includes:

• A **dome-like emission** (top half of the torus)  
• A **dragging return field** (lower curvature return)  
• A nested EMN containment field that flows outward, curves, and recaptures into orbit

This structure defines how galaxies, solar systems, and planets form — by collapse within these layered containment fields.

## Stellar Formation in Containment

Within the galactic field emitted by a black hole:

• Collapse occurs at multiple nodes simultaneously  
• One becomes a star (central singularity of a solar system)  
• Others form planets, moons, and failed stellar cores  
• The Sun becomes the containment anchor of the local field — **not its origin**

The star's own toroidal field locks in and emits a solar EMN containment — like a black hole, but scaled.

## Field-Locked Architecture (Not Orbit)

Traditional models describe orbital motion as gravitational acceleration.  
UQLT replaces this with **field-locked positioning**:

• Each object is **emitted within** and **locked by** EMN field layers  
• Containment, not attraction, holds structure in place  
• This architecture is **self-stabilizing** and **recursively enforced** through EMN field logic

There is no "pull" — only position within recursive emission fields.

## Repeating Through Scale

This recursive field architecture repeats at all levels:

• **Universe**: Primordial collapse → black holes form  
• **Galaxy**: Black holes emit containment fields → collapse forms stars  
• **Solar system**: Stars emit EMN fields → collapse forms planets  
• **Planetary**: Cores emit thermodynamic boundaries → field shell  
• **Atomic**: Collapse into photon lattice → field-bound particles

Each layer forms the structure below it by collapse and containment — never by force or expansion.
