# 📄 E = mc² Reinterpreted: Unit Saturation, Containment Logic, and Light-Speed Equilibrium

## 🧠 Summary

This paper delivers a structural correction of E = mc² based on Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT). It resolves the misconception that relativistic mass “increases” with speed, showing instead that mass and energy are two forms of the same constrained quantity inside fixed atomic substrate units.

- Mass = locked/stabilized energy under field constraint
- Energy = free motion through frequency substrate
- c² = maximum allowable energy saturation per unit (not speed squared)

Einstein’s equation is not a conversion formula—it is a **containment balance law**. The total mass and energy within a unit must equal the saturation limit enforced by field structure. This explains:

- Why no mass can reach light speed (it would require overflow of the unit)
- Why photons have zero mass (they are full energy, zero containment)
- Why energy and mass are not just "equal"—they are **mutually exclusive modes** within one limit

Feynman brushed this edge without formalizing it. This paper completes it.

## 🧱 Key Insight

> **Energy + Mass = c² (per unit constraint)**  
> Full energy = light  
> Full mass = total lock-in  
> All intermediates = sub-saturation phase states

This explains the observed asymptote near light speed **without invoking infinite mass**. Instead, the math shows a **loss of available energy for motion** as mass increases—**not an increase of mass itself**.
