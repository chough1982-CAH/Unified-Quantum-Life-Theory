Speed, time, and energy do not exist independently. They are consequences of constrained motion. When energy flows freely, there is no time, no speed differential, and no measurable energy exchange. These quantities emerge only after resistance imposes delay.

Delay is the physical origin of time.

When energy encounters resistance, propagation between substrate units slows. This slowing introduces a measurable interval between transitions. That interval is what we call time. Time is therefore not a dimension, not a backdrop, and not fundamental — it is the result of resistance.

Once delay exists, speed becomes definable. Speed is simply distance divided by delay. Without delay, speed is meaningless. In free propagation, energy always moves at the maximum permitted rate (light speed). Only structure reduces speed by introducing resistance.

Energy is then derived from constrained speed. Motion under constraint can be converted into energy equivalents. This is why kinetic energy, electrical energy, and radiative energy are all computable from motion rates once resistance exists.

The full conversion chain is:

Resistance → Delay → Time
Time + Distance → Speed
Speed under Constraint → Energy
Delay-induced Oscillation → Frequency

Frequency appears in this chain, but it is not the source. It is the vibration created when constrained energy repeatedly encounters resistance.

This explains why:
- Electrical current produces heat, vibration, and hum only when resistance is present.
- Mechanical motion produces sound only when constrained by material structure.
- Atomic transitions emit radiation only within structured containment.
- Planetary orbits exhibit periodicity only within field confinement.

All energy conversion requires resistance. Without resistance, energy cannot be stored, measured, or transformed. Resistance is not a loss mechanism — it is the mechanism that allows energy to exist in measurable form.

Thus, motion equals energy only after constraint is applied. Unconstrained motion is not energy — it is propagation. Energy is constrained propagation.
