Mass is not a force, not a cause, and not a source of interaction. It is the result of energy
stabilized within Electromagnucleic (EMN) containment under frequency-governed timing
constraints. In the Unified Quantum Life Theory, mass is formally reclassified as an output
state of containment, not a governing agent.

All behaviors historically attributed to gravity — fall rate, weight, attraction, orbital
stability, and equilibrium — arise from collapse into containment rather than from mass
attracting mass. What is measured as gravitational acceleration is the local rate of inward
field collapse, governed by Chronocollapse. Where matter stabilizes within that collapse
field is governed by Valignity, which orders structures by atomic value and containment
compatibility rather than by bulk weight or abstract mass.

Chronocollapse defines how rapidly the EMN field collapses inward toward a fusion core
or active containment node. This collapse rate is independent of the mass of falling objects,
which explains equal fall rates without invoking equivalence principles or vacuum-only
exceptions. Time-rate differentials arise from the same collapse gradient, linking fall rate,
clock behavior, and field saturation under a single mechanism.

Valignity defines positional equilibrium within the collapse field. Objects do not rise, sink,
or hover because of opposing forces, but because their atomic structure seeks compatibility
with the local containment layer. Buoyancy, hover bands, and surface-level neutrality are
therefore native consequences of containment geometry, not fluid-mechanical patches or
secondary effects layered on top of gravity.

The crust of a planetary body is not the source of downward force. It is a resistance boundary
that prevents continued inward collapse. Weight is the reaction force generated when collapse
is blocked by containment. Absent a resisting boundary, all matter would continue inward
along the collapse gradient toward the core.

Frequency is not the substrate of existence. It is the timing constraint governing how energy
propagates between substrate units. The true substrate is a lattice of massless, photon-like
pre-containment potential. Energy does not travel through space as a wave in a medium; it
propagates between substrate units according to frequency timing. Light speed is therefore
a propagation constraint, not a force limit or energetic ceiling.

Atomic structure forms only when EMN containment induces magnetic self-locking within
substrate units. At that point, stabilized energy acquires atomic identity. What is called
“atomic mass” is not a fundamental quantity but the measurable result of successful EMN
containment.

The equatorial plane of a planetary system is identified as a collapse-null boundary where
north–south polar field curvature equilibrates. This equatorial disc defines the natural outer
boundary of stable planetary structure and the surface-level hover band of active cores.
Planetary geometry, atmospheric layering, and orbital discs all follow from this same null
condition.

The term “mass” is therefore recognized as a historical placeholder used to mask missing
mechanisms. It is retained only as a descriptive label, not as an explanatory principle.
Containment replaces attraction. Collapse replaces force. Atomic compatibility replaces
density-based intuition.

Unified Quantum Life Theory replaces gravity with a closed, mechanism-complete framework:
EMN containment defines structure, Chronocollapse defines motion and time rate, and
Valignity defines positional equilibrium.
