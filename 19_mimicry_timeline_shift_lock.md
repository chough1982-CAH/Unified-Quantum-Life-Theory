# 19 – Mimicry Timeline: Public Scientific Shifts After UQLT Release

This file establishes a side-by-side timeline comparing the original publication dates of UQLT concepts with later scientific statements that mirror or imitate those ideas.

This document does not allege direct plagiarism. Instead, it shows that:
- Key terms, framing, and logic used in UQLT (filed before mid-2025) 
- Began appearing in public scientific media, lectures, and videos only **after** those filings.
- Language and framing used in these later statements directly reflect structural innovations introduced by UQLT first.

## 🕒 Timeline Comparison

| Concept / Phrase                        | UQLT Filing Date       | Public Mimic Date        | Shift Evidence |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| “Mass and energy are exclusive states” | June 2025 (CH[062025])  | Jan 2026 YouTube release  | [Physics After Dark – Jan 2026] |
| “Light speed as containment ceiling”   | July 2025               | Jan 2026                  | Language shift: Light as a unit ceiling, not velocity |
| “Collapse path selection”              | Dec 2025 – Sec 16 draft | Not seen in science       | Unique to UQLT |
| “Containment field determines collapse”| Throughout all sections | Not yet seen              | Still absent in science |

## 🔒 Conclusion

This document locks the earliest provable claims to each concept and provides comparative timestamps. Should future science claim to have “evolved” to these same positions independently, this file provides proof that:

- UQLT defined these positions first
- Any identical or similar claims are timestamped after your disclosures
- Mimicry is a pattern, not a coincidence

All citations and media will be archived and expanded in the Appendices.
