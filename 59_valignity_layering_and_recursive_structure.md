## 1. Purpose

To establish a unified, multi-scale containment architecture derived from the Valignity model, demonstrating that all stable systems — from galactic bands to planetary crusts to cellular membranes and atomic orbitals — follow a recursive structure based on core-field interactions, density-alignment mechanics, and field-sealed boundaries.

---

## 2. Framework of Valignity Layering

Valignity redefines gravitational equilibrium not as attraction due to mass, but as **field-sealed ordering** of atomic/molecular densities inside a curved electromagnetic pressure field. This model produces the same stratification behavior at all system scales.

### 2.1 Principle Summary

- **Core Field Emission** (EMNQ): Generates spatial curvature.
- **Seal Formation**: The outer EMNQSphere defines the retention boundary.
- **Elemental Layering**: Elements self-organize by relative density and field resistance.
- **Weight**: Defined as positional fit inside field–curvature gradient (W = ρ_o / ρ_a × curvature factor).
- **Orbital Lane**: Emerges at equilibrium between motion and EMNQ pressure compression.

## 3. Layering Across Physical Scales

| System Level | Core Entity        | Containment Shell       | Banding Structure       | Examples |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------|
| Galaxy       | Supermassive BH    | Galactic EMNQSphere      | Spiral Arms              | Milky Way, Andromeda |
| Stellar      | Fusion Core        | Solar EM Field Boundary  | Planetary Orbits         | Mercury–Neptune |
| Planetary    | Geoglobus Core     | EMNQ Atmospheric Shell   | Stratified Atmosphere    | Troposphere–Exosphere |
| Cellular     | Nucleus            | Electromagnetic Membrane | Organelle Layering       | Mitochondria, Cytosol |
| Atomic       | Nucleus (p/n)      | Quantum Shell Boundary   | Electron Orbitals        | s, p, d, f shells |

Each system emerges from a collapse, forms containment, and then stratifies — guided by energy retention and EMNQ wave equilibrium.

## 4. Heavier-Density Proximity and Planetary Configuration

- The inner planets (Mercury, Venus) are **denser** than gas giants — confirming that **field curvature strength**, not gravitational mass, sets proximity.
- This mirrors **atomic orbital behavior**: heavier particles reside in lower-energy, closer orbitals when containment is maximal.
- Valignity explains this as a result of **field slope and resistance curve**, not Newtonian pull.

## 5. Recursive Field Mechanics

Valignity recursively applies the same 5-phase cycle:

1. **Core Collapse → Fusion ignition**
2. **Fusion → EMNQ field emission**
3. **EM field → Containment shell formation**
4. **Containment → Layered stratification**
5. **Equilibrium → Emergent structure**

This sequence is **quantifiable**, **observable**, and applicable to:

- Orbital lane formation
- Atmospheric banding
- Molecular layering
- Biological cell regulation
W = Observed weight
ρ_o = object density
ρ_a = ambient medium density
E*, B* = stellar field strength
Ep, Bp = local planetary field
T = local temperature
v = relative velocity
R = radius from core

## 6. Testable Equations and Field Indices
Locked functional forms:

 6.1 Weight from Field Alignment:
-math-
W = Φ(ρ_o, ρ_a, E*, B*, Ep, Bp, μ, T, v, R)
W = Observed weight
ρ_o = object density
ρ_a = ambient medium density
E*, B* = stellar field strength
Ep, Bp = local planetary field
T = local temperature
v = relative velocityR
R = radius from core

---

 6.2 Float–Sink Index:
FSI = ρ_o / ρ_a

---

6.3 Local World Index:
LWI = (ρ_surface / ρ_atm)^α × (1 + λ × EM_index)
Predicts hover-states, buoyancy zones, orbital retention or loss conditions.

---

7. Biological and Atomic Mirror Dynamics
Cellular systems mimic solar dynamics:
Nucleus = Core → emits EMN-type control signals
Membrane = Atmospheric seal → defines what is retained
Organelles = satellites, bound within zones
Quantum orbital shells are discrete EM-bound states obeying same curvature layering rules.
Prediction: Recursive banding symmetry will be observable in:
Spectral decomposition
Orbital resonance ratios
Electron excitation ladders
Membrane ion-channel organization

8. Cosmological Implications

 8.1 Orbit Is Not Mass-Driven Alone
Stronger EM cores (e.g., the Sun) dominate orbital anchoring — not from mass, but from core EMNQ field coherence.
Predicts: Reversing a core’s EMN emission → reassigns orbital locks.

---

8.2 Planetary Role in System Seal
Planets act as containment stabilizers. Their orbits shape field layering.
The solar system EMNQSphere is co-stabilized by:
Core fusion output (AuraElius)
Planetary distribution (mass & EM feedback)
