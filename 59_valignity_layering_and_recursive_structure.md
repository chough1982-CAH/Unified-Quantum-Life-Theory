## I. Overview  
This paper documents the multi-scale recursive layering model derived from Valignity, confirming structural symmetry from galactic bands down to atomic layering and cellular behavior. Each band or orbital layer expresses the same field-containment principle shaped by EMNQ energy emission, curvature resistance, and density-field equilibrium.

## II. Containment Layers Across Scales

| Scale           | Core Anchor       | Banding Layer        | Seal Type              | Example                                      |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Galaxy         | Supermassive Core | Spiral Arms          | Galactic EMNQSphere     | Milky Way, Andromeda                         |
| Solar System   | Solar Fusion Core | Planetary Orbits     | Solar EMNQSphere        | Mercury to Neptune orbit lanes               |
| Planet         | Planetary Core    | Atmospheric Bands     | Planetary EMNQShell     | Troposphere → Exosphere layering             |
| Cell           | Nucleus           | Organelle Shells      | Membrane Field Layer    | Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic containment    |
| Atom           | Proton/Neutron    | Electron Shells       | Electromagnetic Shell   | Quantum orbitals (s, p, d...)                |

## III. Valignity Field Rule Extension

Each of the following principles scales upward and downward from the planetary model:

1. **Core Energy Sets Field Strength**  
   → Fusion or decay rate defines output intensity.

2. **Field Sets Containment Shells**  
   → EMNQ-derived shell defines "how far" matter can stably orbit.

3. **Seal Enables Stratification**  
   → Layering of elements (or orbitals) only forms once the seal stabilizes.

4. **Density Matches Field Curvature**  
   → Denser objects/particles settle closer to the core within a tighter curvature well.

## IV. Planetary Mass vs. Core Proximity

- The densest and heaviest planets (Mercury, Venus) are **closest to the sun**, proving that the field **pulls elements by density**, not just mass.
- Analogous to atomic orbitals — **heavier electrons** (higher energy states) sit in closer orbitals when excited but fall inward on collapse.
- This aligns with **layered atomic banding** in both quantum and EM-scale field systems.

## V. Cellular & Atomic Mirroring

- Nucleus = Planetary Core  
- Membrane = EMNQSphere  
- Mitochondria / Ribosomes = Satellite-like processing nodes  
- Cellular fields = EM pressure zones between internal banding  
- Weight of molecular structures = EM alignment within cellular field

## VI. Galaxy–Solar–Planet–Cell Cascade

**Nested EMNQFields and Valignity Seals:**
Galaxy (macro-core) ↳ Stars/Suns (field sub-cores) ↳ Planets (internal fusion → local field containment) ↳ Cells (field-regulated biology) ↳ Atoms (quantum EM curvature)
Each level recurses the same core-field-layer-seal-element dynamic.

## VII. Locked Equations and Test Outcomes

**Tested and Locked:**
- Field-layer equation structure: `W = Φ(ρo, ρa, E*, B*, Ep, Bp, µ, T, v, R)`
- FSI (Float–Sink Index): `FSI = ρo / ρa`
- LWI (Local World Index): `LWI = (ρsurface / ρatm)^α * (1 + λ * EM_index)`
- Valignity band predictions matched orbital banding (solar and atomic)
- Heaviest objects orbiting closest verified in solar and electron shells

---

## VIII. Future Directions

- Create scaled containment maps for each system
- Run LWI → FSI predictive model on Venus, Mars, Jupiter
- Compare galaxy EM banding to solar EMNQ layers
- Design experimental cell membrane simulation using EM curvature shell mimicry
