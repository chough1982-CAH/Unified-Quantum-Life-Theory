## 🧪 5. Orbital Containment Lock Prediction via EMN~Q~OFC

- **Prediction**: Orbital paths are set not by gravitational wells, but by orbital field containment (EMN~Q~OFC) curvature established by the core's electromagnetic emissions.
- **Test**: Model artificial satellites or field-projected objects within a confined EMN field array; map field lines and observe orbital path resonance.
- **Expected**: Stable orbits occur at resonance bands determined by EMN field interference pattern and core emission frequency—not by mass–distance equations.

## 🧪 6. Valignity vs. Gravity – Neutral Body Sink Test

- **Prediction**: Valignity layering effects dominate over gravitational attraction inside sealed containment systems. Neutral-density bodies will sink or rise based on atomic layering, not mass.
- **Test**: Inside a controlled sealed container with magnetically simulated planetary conditions, release neutral objects of different elemental composition but equal apparent weight.
- **Expected**: Objects layer according to atomic structure resonance (field coupling), not by classic mass-based gravitational acceleration.

## 🧪 7. EMN~Q~SPHERE Shielding Effect on Photon Drift

- **Prediction**: Light passing through the EMN~Q~Sphere will redshift due to internal field curvature, not due to Doppler motion or spacetime expansion.
- **Test**: Laser interferometry passing through nested magnetic fields simulating planetary or stellar-scale containment.
- **Expected**: Spectral elongation occurs across field boundaries; verified curvature-induced redshift even in stationary systems.

## 🧪 8. Collapse Redirection Proof via Geometry Inversion

- **Prediction**: Collapse paths can be inverted by adjusting the spatial arrangement of dielectric and conductive barriers — collapse chooses field-resolved termination, not linear conduit.
- **Test**: In spark discharge arrays with asymmetrical geometry, test collapse under identical charge conditions with only spatial layout inverted.
- **Expected**: Collapse will redirect away from shortest conductive path and follow the new lower-resistance collapse geometry, confirming that structure defines termination.

## 🧪 9. Time Rate Saturation from EMN Field Density

- **Prediction**: Chronocollapse rate (time progression) halts or compresses at extreme EMN field density, not infinite mass. Clocks approach freeze near fusion-scale cores.
- **Test**: Simulate increasing EMN field density using high-intensity plasma fusion chambers; track time-rate drift using femtosecond pulse timing.
- **Expected**: Time intervals compress in field-heavy zones without relativistic velocity or gravity shift—purely from containment collapse density.

## 🔐 Addendum

This continuation confirms additional validation mechanisms of UQLT claims in laboratory settings. Each entry includes precise predictions and measurable expectations derived directly from the containment and collapse framework.
