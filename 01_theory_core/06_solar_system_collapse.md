## Unified Formation Model

In the Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT), the solar system forms through a single, unified collapse event. The Sun, planets, moons, and other bodies do not form in sequence or from debris. They emerge together, simultaneously, within the same containment structure.

This collapse occurs inside the galactic orbital field emitted by a black hole. Within that field, multiple cores collapse. One becomes the singularity known as the Sun, while others collapse into planets, moons, and failed stellar cores.

## Role of the Sun

The Sun is not the generator of the system, but one of its results. It becomes the system’s central singularity, serving the same structural role as a black hole does within a galaxy.

• It forms at the same time as all other major bodies  
• It does not emit or create the planets after its formation  
• Its toroidal field provides stability and structure, but not origin

The solar system is not constructed around the Sun — it collapses with it, as a complete recursive structure.

## Containment Principle

All bodies form within the same nested containment field:

• Galactic black hole emits EMN orbital drag  
• Collapse occurs within that field  
• Collapse singularity and planetary bodies form at once  
• Each emits its own localized field  
• The structure repeats at planetary and atomic scales

## Intellectual Ownership

This model of simultaneous stellar and planetary collapse within unified containment is original to Unified Quantum Life Theory.

It replaces stepwise formation and accretion-based models with structural recursion and field dynamics.
