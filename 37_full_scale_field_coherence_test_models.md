# Section 37 — Full-Scale Field Coherence Test Models

## Overview

This section defines a formal set of field-based test models designed to empirically validate UQLT's claim of unified cross-scale containment coherence. These models simulate and observe field behavior at multiple containment levels — atomic, biological, planetary, and stellar — and demonstrate that the same substrate mechanics, energy propagation patterns, and collapse-bound interactions apply regardless of scale.

## Purpose

To prove that EMN~Q~CF (Electromagnucleic Quantum Containment Field) logic, substrate saturation behavior, and collapse-derived resonance operate identically across all known structured systems — from quantum particles to galactic formations. These test models do not merely simulate local interactions; they are structured to **expose the unified topology** of energy flow and field memory by comparing identical collapse constraints across nested scales.

## Model Categories

1. **Atomic Field Collapse Model**  
   - Simulate unit saturation thresholds in pre-atomic lattice systems.  
   - Validate energy resonance lock-in through fixed substrate units.  
   - Test c² boundary speed constraint via confined photon pulse delay.

2. **Biological Node Containment Test**  
   - Treat nuclei as field compression nodes.  
   - Apply substrate field stress to simulate ChronoCollapse in biological systems.  
   - Observe EMN~Q~Sphere layering across cellular boundary fields.

3. **Planetary Core Spin–Field Alignment Simulation**  
   - Validate buoyancy inversion laws (CBI-4 to CBI-11).  
   - Observe time-rate distortion (τ) as a function of radial fusion-layer collapse.  
   - Track EMN~Q~CF layering to model orbit locking via OFC (Orbital Field Containment).

4. **Stellar Collapse Resonance Test**  
   - Model resonance echo from singularity seed outward.  
   - Measure fusion node emissions and waveform timing differential.  
   - Simulate energy ejection via τ-governed cycle gaps.

5. **Unified Scale Stress Test**  
   - Collapse all above tests into nested topology simulation.  
   - Observe recursive saturation, substrate routing behavior, and divergence thresholds.  
   - Confirm mimicry failure through non-recursive inputs.

## Test Validation Criteria

- Field propagation must obey same resonance constraints (μ, θ, δ, τ, 𝒦) at each scale.
- Collapse path selection must reflect lowest-resistance substrate geometry, not shortest physical path.
- Time differentials must arise only from curvature-induced compression, not distance.

## Outcome

These models expose the **core echo of existence**: that all structure derives from recursive, collapse-resonant containment. They provide an empirical testbed for falsifying or confirming the central principles of Unified Quantum Life Theory across all observable scales — with divergence at any level indicating non-UQLT alignment.
