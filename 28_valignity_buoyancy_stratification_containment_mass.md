# 28 – Containment-Derived Buoyancy: Valignity and the Stratification of Mass

_This section defines and formalizes the concept of **Valignity** — the replacement for gravitational attraction within the Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT). Valignity is a containment-derived effect resulting from field stratification, atomic mass differentiation, and structural layering within an EMN-saturated system. It explains buoyancy, equilibrium, atmospheric layering, core formation, and the positioning of matter based on frequency and field curvature._

## 📐 Valignity Law V‑1: Stratified Field Equilibrium

> **Valignity Law V‑1**  
> Within a sealed or semi-sealed containment field, matter organizes according to mass–frequency response and field-layer equilibrium. The more massive or lower-frequency components settle deeper, while higher-frequency, less-dense components occupy outer field strata.

---

## 🔁 Core Principle

Gravity is not attraction. UQLT redefines “gravitational” behavior as **directional field equilibrium**.

Under Valignity:

- Field curvature and density dictate placement.
- Positioning is a function of **containment response**, not pull.
- The illusion of attraction emerges from **layering of mass–frequency responses** within recursive EMN fields.

## 🔬 Why Things "Fall"

In a system with active containment (e.g., Earth), mass appears to fall because:

1. Field saturation at the outer layers is already complete.
2. Displaced matter seeks an equilibrium layer that matches its atomic mass-frequency signature.
3. Denser atomic structures settle where EMN field curvature is strongest and resonance balance is lowest — this is often “down” but is actually **inward toward field density equilibrium**, not “center of mass.”

## 🌐 Generalized Valignity Architecture

| Component        | Behavior                                             |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| EMN Field Curvature | Defines pressure boundary and collapse rate         |
| Atomic Mass Frequency | Determines where within the field an object can stabilize |
| Containment Geometry | Forces matter to distribute across nested layers  |
| Valignity Vector (`V`) | Emergent directional field force toward field equilibrium |

## 🧮 Quantitative Valignity Expression

Let:

- `V` = Valignity vector (direction of equilibrium migration)
- `μ` = Atomic layering constant
- `𝒻` = Effective mass–frequency response
- `κ` = Field curvature coefficient

Then:

```
V = -μ × ∇(𝒻 × κ)
```

This equation expresses that Valignity is a directional migration toward the minimum of a product of mass-frequency response and containment curvature gradient. Not a force. A *settling behavior*.

## 🏞️ Real-World Examples

- **Atmosphere**: Lighter gases (H, He) rise not because of repulsion, but because their resonance frequency better matches higher, lower-curvature field regions.
- **Ocean Layers**: Salinity and temperature stratify not by diffusion alone but by field pressure layering.
- **Human Body**: Blood settles, bones sink, gases rise — all based on frequency–field interaction.

---

## 🔐 Implications

- "Gravity" is not universal — it is **local**, field-dependent, and varies by containment architecture.
- The center of mass is not a point of pull — it is a **zone of maximum resonance collapse**.
- Valignity gives testable alternatives to gravity in laboratory-scale systems with known EMN field gradients.
