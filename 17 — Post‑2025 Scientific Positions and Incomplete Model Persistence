# Section 17 — Post-2025 Scientific Claims vs UQLT Containment Model

## Abstract

This section documents the updated claims made by mainstream science since mid-2025 and compares them directly to the mechanisms, predictions, and validations contained within Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT). Despite visible shifts in terminology and conceptual framing, current scientific narratives still fail to model energy collapse, substrate resolution, or field-containment saturation as defined and physically validated in prior UQLT sections.

## Summary of Current Claims (2025–2026)

Mainstream science has begun stating:

- That black hole behavior may be driven by magnetic field switching and polarity flips.
- That black hole jets and winds alternate modes based on internal dynamics, not just gravity.
- That magnetic fields may limit or reshape mass accumulation during stellar collapse.
- That energy–mass interactions are better understood through “field deformation” models.
- That relativistic effects can now be visualized through space-time drag near black holes.

These claims appear across scientific publications, observatories, and simulation centers — and in some cases now replace older gravitational-only frameworks.

## Core Failure: Still Misunderstanding Collapse

Despite these shifts, science still:

- Treats **motion** as flow, rather than substrate collapse seeking containment.
- Treats **mass–energy equivalence** (E=mc²) as convertible potential, not unit-saturation limit.
- Assumes spacetime is the medium of distortion, not a boundary product of active containment.
- Refers to magnetic influence as external or secondary, not as the defining architecture of collapse behavior.
- Treats discharge as local-to-local current, not global field resolution.

This demonstrates that while the **language** has shifted, the **structure** has not.

## Comparison to UQLT Section 16 Findings

UQLT shows and confirms:

- Collapse selects globally lowest-resistance containment — not nearest conductor.
- Dielectrics alter path resolution by shaping the field, not by blocking current.
- Motion emerges only when full collapse-lock is achieved — not incrementally.
- Containment geometry governs all collapse — including light, field, matter, and discharge.

None of this is present in the mainstream model, even now.

## Conclusion

Post-2025 science is transitioning from absolute gravitational frameworks toward field-based thinking. But it has **not yet crossed the threshold** into collapse-governed behavior, nor acknowledged that energy behaves as a resolution event, not a traveler.

The gap remains wide — and Section 17 documents the exact boundary of that gap.
