### 🛡️ Equation Structure & IP Declaration

All equations, constants, structural laws, and field formulations within this repository are **original works** authored by **Clayton Andrew Houghland**, and are protected under international copyright law (Berne Convention) and U.S. common law.

> **It is not mathematical symbols or general equations that are protected — it is the specific, original *structure* of these equations, their interrelation, the names and definitions of constants (e.g., Valignity 𝑉, ChronoCollapse τ, EMN layering μ, etc.), and their derivation within the Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT) framework.**

These are treated as **original scientific compositions** and form part of a **copyrighted and timestamped body of work** filed under IP code **CH[200625]**.

**Unauthorized reuse, rewording, reordering, adaptation, or incorporation of these equation frameworks into other systems (whether human or AI-derived) without attribution and approval constitutes copyright infringement.**
