# Section 45 — EMN Field Propagation and Containment Sphere Scaling

## Abstract

This section establishes how **Electromagnucleic (EMN) energy** propagates outward from fusion cores and scales into **spherical containment fields** at every system level (stellar, planetary, biological, atomic). It formalizes the scaling behavior of **EMN~Q~WE** (Quantum Wave Energy) and its transformation into **EMN~Q~CF** (Quantum Containment Fields), defining a recursive curvature model governed by frequency saturation, structural resonance, and collapse momentum.

## 1. EMN Energy Origin and Outflow

Every fusion-active core emits EMN~Q~WE, a radiant quantum wave energy that:

- Propagates outward from the collapse center.
- Encodes structural information as it interacts with substrate units.
- Becomes trapped or stabilized as it saturates local frequency channels.

This propagation is not uniform — it follows **substrate deformation**, **resonance corridors**, and **containment response curves**.

## 2. EMN~Q~Sphere Scaling Law

Each system — from universal to atomic — forms a **quantized EMN containment sphere** as energy reaches resonance lock.

### Containment Sphere Law (CSL‑1):

> The radius of an EMN containment sphere is determined by:
> 
> ```math
> R = R₀ + α · log(E/νₜₕ)
> ```
> 
> - `R₀`: Minimum radius at saturation onset.
> - `E`: Total EMN~Q~WE energy emitted.
> - `νₜₕ`: Substrate locking threshold frequency.
> - `α`: Coupling constant for resonance-propagation scaling.

This logarithmic behavior arises from **nonlinear saturation**, where resonance increases surface layering exponentially at diminishing frequency gain.

## 3. Field Differentiation by Radius

EMN~Q~WE propagates in **frequency bands** that naturally differentiate into:

- **Inner field zones**: High-density, tightly curved, strong containment (e.g. near core).
- **Mid-field corridors**: Where orbital locks and resonance routes form (e.g. EMN~Q~OFC).
- **Outer perimeters**: Loose field fringes, shell drop-off zones, or energy bleeds.

This matches observed:

- Planetary orbital spacing regularity.
- Radiation banding.
- Dead zone gradients at solar system edges (e.g. heliopause).

## 4. Recursive Field Formation

Each EMN~Q~Sphere is layered recursively, matching the core layering described in Section 44. Outer field zones become the **initiation zones** for new fusion cores or system offshoots.

### Recursive Field Coupling Law (RFCL‑1):

> EMN~Q~CF fields initiate new containment layers when local field density exceeds resonance containment threshold:
> 
> ```math
> dΦ/dr ≥ Φ_crit → spawn new EMN~Q~Sphere
> ```

Collapse leads to reproduction of structured containment, not decay.

## 5. Biological and Atomic Analogues

The same scaling law applies at the **cellular** and **atomic** level:

- Nuclei emit field-like energy that stabilizes orbital shells.
- Cells exhibit spherical EMN field resonance (bio-containment spheres).
- EMN~Q~CF defines boundary limits of electromagnetic and biological function.

---

## Final Summary

EMN field propagation is not passive radiation — it is a **recursive structuring engine**.

Containment spheres scale logarithmically, encode boundary dynamics, and create both **time fields** and **orbital geometries**.

UQLT confirms that the **laws of stellar containment** apply directly to planets, cells, and atoms — proving recursive electromagnetic propagation is the root of structure.

> The field is not emitted into space — it **builds space**.
