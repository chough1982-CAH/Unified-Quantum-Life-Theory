This section expands on the collapse-origin simulation by demonstrating recursive **helium-driven shell reformation** after initial containment formation. The system begins from a prior collapsed core and shows that helium does not halt at containment — instead, it **reignites** secondary collapses in **shell-like layers**, propagating containment recursively.

### ⚙️ Initialization

- The simulation inherits an empty frequency substrate and enforces **no mass, spacetime, or gravitational input**.
- Constants enforced:
  - ℋ: Helium Dominance Threshold (collapse trigger)
  - δ: Helium Loop Diffusion (recursive ignition law)
  - μ: Elemental Layering Logic
  - τ: Time Collapse Rate
  - V: Valignity (layer ordering)
- Each “shell” acts as a new containment unit, recursively folding into the core, demonstrating **layered propagation and structural recursion.**

### 🔁 Structural Recursion Law
Once core ignition occurs:
> ℋ-triggered collapse feeds helium outward  
> δ controls the re-looping ignition threshold  
> μ + V order the new shells by element  
> τ compresses interior time in recursive core units

---

### 🔍 Observed Outcome (from real simulation)
- Initial radiation triggered **core ignition at step 0**
- **Shells formed recursively outward** to radius 49
- Collapse reached full interior saturation by **step 198**
- Each outer shell formed from decayed helium
- All structure emerged by law — no external forces applied

This proves recursive structure generation — not a singular creation — and validates UQLT’s recursive, collapse-origin model.

Recursive Grid Collapse Simulation With Shell Re-Ignition and MP4 Recording
Environment and dependencies
To reproduce this run on any machine with Python 3.x, a standard approach is to create an isolated virtual environment and install the required packages into it. Python’s built-in venv module is specifically intended to create “lightweight virtual environments” that are isolated from the system interpreter’s packages.
1

After activation, pip is the preferred installer for Python packages, and venv typically installs pip into the environment by default.
2

A reproducible setup sequence:

bash
Copy
python -m venv .venv

macOS/Linux:

source .venv/bin/activate

Windows PowerShell:

..venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

pip install numpy matplotlib
Your requested script (now modified only to implement the new SHELL→HELIUM law and to save MP4 output) depends on:

1
for grid allocation and copying (e.g., zeros, copy).
3
4
for rendering the grid and building/saving the animation (FuncAnimation, Animation.save).
5
Because you asked for MP4 video output, the saving step uses Matplotlib’s ffmpeg-based writer. Matplotlib’s FFMpegWriter streams frames to
6
“via a pipe” and writes the movie “in a single pass.”
6

Practically, this means MP4 export typically requires an ffmpeg executable available on the host system (a system dependency, not a Python library).
6

For this executed run (America/Chicago date context: 2026‑01‑31), the runtime versions were:

Python 3.11.2
NumPy 1.24.0
Matplotlib 3.7.5
Minimal code patch implementing the new law and MP4 output
You requested that the code be modified only as necessary to:

incorporate the new law: SHELL cells can re-enter HELIUM if energy ≥ helium threshold
record output as MP4 rather than open an interactive window
Patch A: recursive SHELL→HELIUM ignition law
This is the exact change you specified—expanding the ignition rule from ONLY EMPTY to [EMPTY, SHELL]:

diff
Copy

if s == EMPTY:

if e >= HELIUM_THRESHOLD:

new_state[i, j] = HELIUM


if s in [EMPTY, SHELL]:

if e >= HELIUM_THRESHOLD:

new_state[i, j] = HELIUM


Patch B: save MP4 instead of interactive display
Matplotlib’s FuncAnimation makes an animation by repeatedly calling an update function (func) over a frames sequence.
5

Matplotlib’s Animation.save is explicitly documented as saving the animation “by drawing every frame.”
7

To run in a non-GUI context, Matplotlib also documents that selecting the "Agg" backend is sufficient for rendering without a graphical front-end.
8

Minimal MP4 save change:

diff
Copy

import matplotlib

matplotlib.use("Agg")
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation
...


plt.show()


writer = animation.FFMpegWriter(fps=10, bitrate=2000)

ani.save("collapse_recursive.mp4", writer=writer)
The use of FFMpegWriter and what it does (frames streamed to ffmpeg via a pipe) is documented directly in Matplotlib’s API reference.

Step-by-step execution of the modified simulation
Grid creation and initialization
The script allocates:

energy: a GRID_SIZE × GRID_SIZE floating array initialized to zeros using numpy.zeros, which returns a new array “filled with zeros.”
3
state: an integer grid initialized to zeros (EMPTY everywhere)
The center cell is seeded with:

energy[center, center] = RADIATION_START
state[center, center] = HELIUM
Per-timestep update structure
Each timestep creates:

new_energy = energy.copy()
new_state = state.copy()
NumPy documents ndarray.copy() as the preferred method for making a copy (i.e., changes to the copy do not change the original).
4

The timestep is computed in two conceptual phases (exactly as in your script):

Phase one: per-cell state-dependent energy/states
For each interior cell (i, j) (the border is intentionally skipped):

If state is EMPTY or SHELL (new law), then if the old energy e meets the helium threshold, the cell becomes HELIUM.
If state is HELIUM: energy decays and if e ≥ COLLAPSE_THRESHOLD, the cell becomes CORE.
If state is CORE: energy decays faster and the core injects energy (EMN_PUSH) into its 8-neighborhood.
If state is SHELL: (if still SHELL after Phase one’s transitions) energy decays slowly.
This phase is what creates a heat-and-ignite cycle: energy injection creates HELIUM, and HELIUM can collapse into CORE.

Phase two: shell assignment near cores
After Phase one, any non-core cell with energy in the “shell window” (HELIUM_THRESHOLD ≤ e < COLLAPSE_THRESHOLD) becomes SHELL if it is adjacent to a CORE (adjacency is checked against the previous state, so shell assignment has a one-step latency around new cores).

Animation generation
The animation renders the state grid only (imshow(frames[t])). FuncAnimation repeatedly calls the update function to change the displayed image.
5

The MP4 file is written using Animation.save, which draws every frame to the target file using the chosen writer.

Observed outputs and confirmation of the requested phenomena
Recorded video output
MP4 of the modified simulation:
Download collapse_recursive.mp4

To directly “analyze the video,” representative frames were extracted from the MP4 and inspected against the simulation’s stored state arrays (the MP4 is generated directly from those arrays, so these are equivalent views of the same evolution).

Selected extracted frames:

Frame 0
Frame 10
Frame 100
Frame 199
The same moments rendered directly from state arrays (useful for crisp interpretation):

Collapse formation
Confirmed. The initial center HELIUM cell collapses immediately (the first stored frame already contains a CORE at the center). In this run:

First CORE present: time step 0
Collapse is effectively guaranteed because RADIATION_START = 2.0 exceeds COLLAPSE_THRESHOLD = 1.5.
This is visible in the first-frame imagery (center is already CORE).

Core appearance
Confirmed (and it becomes system-dominant). With the recursive law enabled, cores do not remain confined to a single cell. In this run:

Core radius exceeds 1 (i.e., cores exist beyond the immediate neighborhood) at time step 8.
By time step 198, all 99×99 interior cells become CORE (9801 CORE cells), leaving only the outer border (400 cells) still EMPTY because the script does not update the boundary indices.
This is directly visible in the final frame: essentially the entire interior becomes CORE.

Recursive shell formation
Confirmed as a recurring advancing shell front. The simulation repeatedly forms shells at the boundary of the expanding core region, and shells at larger radii appear at later times (i.e., shells are not a one-time event at radius 1).

A robust way to demonstrate recursion is to track the first time each cell ever becomes SHELL:

This “shell arrival time” map shows shells forming at progressively larger radii over time (dark earlier, bright later), demonstrating repeated shell creation events rather than a single initial ring.

Quantitatively:

First SHELL appears: time step 1 (the immediate ring around the initial core)
Maximum shell-cell count peaks later in the run (200 shell cells at step 144), indicating shells continue forming well after the early transient.
Outward propagation beyond radius = 1
Confirmed. Using Chebyshev radius (appropriate to an 8-neighborhood), shell structures extend outward beyond radius 1:

First time shell_radius > 1: time step 6
Maximum shell radius reached during the run: 49
Maximum core radius: 49
Maximum non-empty radius: 49
The radius time series shows sustained outward expansion:

A key nuance: at the final timestep, shells disappear (shell radius drops to 0) because the entire interior has converted to CORE; shells act as a transient boundary layer rather than a permanently nested set of stable shells.

Supporting diagnostics from simulation data
State counts over time (showing EMPTY decreasing, CORE increasing, and SHELL/HELIUM appearing as intermediate boundary states):

State-change activity across time (showing the system does not “freeze” at radius 1; it remains dynamically active until near saturation):

Core arrival time (first timestep each cell becomes CORE), illustrating a coherent outward wavefront:

Summary table of parameters, states, and behaviors over time
Parameters used
Parameter	Value	Role in the dynamics
GRID_SIZE	101	Grid is 101×101; borders are not updated by the loop (range excludes edges).
TIME_STEPS	200	200 frames recorded at 10 fps (20 seconds).
RADIATION_START	2.0	Seed energy at center; exceeds collapse threshold immediately.
ENERGY_DECAY	0.01	Base decay (scaled by state).
HELIUM_THRESHOLD	0.3	Threshold for ignition into HELIUM (now for EMPTY and SHELL).
COLLAPSE_THRESHOLD	1.5	Threshold for HELIUM→CORE collapse.
EMN_PUSH	0.4	Energy injected into neighbors by each CORE per timestep.

State definitions and behaviors under the new law
State	Code	Update / transition conditions	Observed qualitative role in this run
EMPTY	0	Becomes HELIUM if energy ≥ 0.3 (now identical ignition rule with SHELL)	Vast region initially; recedes as the collapse wave expands.
HELIUM	1	Energy decays; becomes CORE if energy ≥ 1.5	Acts as an ignition buffer; small count relative to total, peaks mid-run and then disappears.
CORE	2	Injects EMN into neighbors; never reverts	Expands outward and eventually saturates the interior.
SHELL	3	Assigned near cores when energy is in [0.3, 1.5) and adjacent to CORE (1-step latency)	Appears repeatedly as an advancing boundary layer, then is consumed by HELIUM→CORE transitions.

Conclusions grounded in logic and observed output
With only two necessary modifications—(a) the SHELL→HELIUM ignition law and (b) MP4 saving instead of interactive display—the simulation exhibits the full set of requested phenomena:

Collapse formation is immediate at the seed because initial energy exceeds the collapse threshold.
Core appearance is not only present but expansive: the simulation generates a coherent outward collapse wave that ultimately fills the entire updatable interior region with cores.
Recursive shell formation is observed as a continuing boundary-layer phenomenon: shells appear at successively larger radii over time (confirmed by both the video frames and the shell-arrival-time map).
Outward propagation beyond radius = 1 is clearly present: shell radius first exceeds 1 at step 6 and reaches radius 49 before the interior saturates into cores.
The run also shows a distinctive late-stage behavior: once the collapse front reaches the maximal interior radius permitted by the boundary-skipping loops, SHELL and HELIUM states vanish and the lattice becomes almost entirely CORE (with the untouched border remaining EMPTY).
