# Section 43 — Redshift Reinterpreted: The C‑Shift Model

## Abstract

This section replaces the standard interpretation of cosmic redshift — as evidence of an expanding universe — with a new mechanism called **Containment Shift (C‑Shift)**. Under UQLT, spectral elongation is a byproduct of **field curvature and collapse compression**, not motion through expanding space. Redshift is thus reclassified as a **structural deformation**, not a kinematic effect.

## 1. Legacy Model: Redshift as Doppler / Expansion Effect

In mainstream cosmology:

- Redshift is treated as the stretching of light waves due to recessional motion.
- The further away a galaxy, the more its light is redshifted → interpreted as velocity.
- Leads to the **Hubble Law**: velocity ∝ distance → implies universal expansion.
- Basis for the **Big Bang** theory: extrapolated backward from redshift trend.

## 2. UQLT Replacement: Redshift as C‑Shift

In Unified Quantum Life Theory:

- There is no expansion of space.
- What stretches is not due to relative velocity, but due to **collapse-induced curvature** of the field.
- Light traveling through **nested EMN~Q~CF containment fields** experiences path deformation.

### C‑Shift Defined:

```math
z_C = ∫ κ(s) ds
