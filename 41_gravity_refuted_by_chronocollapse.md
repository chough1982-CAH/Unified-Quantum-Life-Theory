# Section 41 — Gravity Refuted by Chronocollapse: Time Differential Proof of Collapse-Curvature Dominance

## Abstract

This section formally refutes the concept of “gravity” as a fundamental force caused by mass. Instead, it establishes time differential as a collapse-based, curvature-driven phenomenon governed by τ (Chronocollapse constant) and κ_EMN(r) (containment curvature coefficient). The observed behavior of time in proximity to mass is not due to attraction — it is due to localized containment collapse geometry.

UQLT replaces mass‑based gravity with **field-driven temporal compression**, mathematically modeled and falsifiable via time-rate experiments.

## 1. Classical Claim

According to General Relativity:

- **Mass curves spacetime**.
- Objects follow geodesics in curved space.
- Clocks tick slower in stronger gravitational fields due to time dilation from spacetime curvature.

This model assumes mass generates curvature passively and that time deformation is a result of the observer’s relative frame.

## 2. UQLT Refutation Framework

UQLT asserts:

- **Curvature is not caused by mass.**
- Curvature emerges from **EMN~Q~CF containment collapse**, originating from a fusion core.
- Time differential is caused by **collapse-rate geometry**, not spacetime deformation by mass.

The rate of time (t) in any region is defined by:

```math
d(ln t)/dr = τ · κ_EMN(r) · G(r)
