## 🔷 Core Principle

**Valignity** replaces gravity as the **true cause of weight, vertical layering, and structural ordering** inside any sealed or semi-sealed containment field.

It describes how objects settle, float, or “weigh” something — not because of a force pulling on mass — but because of how **atomic density, field interaction, and containment geometry** create equilibrium zones.

## 🔷 Mechanism Summary

In a field-bound system (like a planet, chamber, star, or orbital bubble):

- All objects are surrounded by a structured medium (air, fluid, plasma, etc.)  
- Their position is determined by **atomic mass, energy interaction, and medium resistance**  
- “Weight” is not universal — it is local, conditional, and defined by the **field containment** that holds structure in place  

This is **not gravity**. It is **Valignity**.

## 🔷 Valignity Laws

**Law V1 — Ordering by Density Ratio**  
Objects in a field-bound medium seek equilibrium positions based on their density relative to the surrounding medium.

**Law V2 — Hover Bands Exist**  
Each field-medium has natural “hover bands” where net settling force equals zero. Objects of matching atomic profile will float at that level.

**Law V3 — Seal Dependency**  
No containment, no order. If the seal of a system is broken (loss of atmospheric boundaries, chamber walls, magnetic fields), valignity ceases and structural ordering collapses.

**Law V4 — Layer-Locking**  
Atomic elements stratify into nested zones. Higher-density elements seek deeper layers unless locked by field dynamics. This replaces gravitational stratification.

## 🔷 What Valignity Replaces

| Legacy Model                         | UQLT Replacement                         |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Gravity as weight                   | Valignity from field-bound density ratios |
| Mass-based attraction               | Atomic field response + containment rules |
| Universal “g”                       | Local field-variable collapse strength    |
| Pressure = downforce from gravity   | Pressure = field resistance & seal load   |
| Layering by pull                    | Layering by EM seal + atomic interaction  |

## 🔷 Key Concepts

- **Containment** creates the seal that holds pressure, layering, and weight  
- **Medium** is the fluid/gas/plasma the object is in (air, water, solar plasma, etc.)  
- **Field geometry** defines how energy flows and supports mass distribution  
- **Atomic identity** sets each object’s natural “level”  
- **Weight** is just a reaction to prevented collapse

## 🔷 Proof of Superior Mechanism

Valignity passes real-world tests that gravity fails at when scaled to:

- Chamber experiments with neutral buoyancy  
- Plasma systems in toroidal fields  
- Non-Earth atmospheres and rotating systems  
- Systems with inverted layering (helium above hydrogen, etc.)  
- Simulated planetary cores where gravity can’t explain equilibrium

## 🔷 Summary: What Valignity Is

> Valignity is not a force.  
> It is a **field-bound, seal-locked equilibrium behavior** of matter — predictable by atomic profile, field shape, and containment strength.

It explains everything gravity is used for — but with **real physical mechanisms**, not abstract warps or universal attraction.
