# Section 35 — EMN‑Q Containment Diagnostics: Time Curvature, Field Memory, and Predictive Observables

## Abstract
This section establishes the diagnostic framework for analyzing time-based propagation delays, energy routing, and field memory using the containment-layer architecture of UQLT. It introduces containment path engineering principles as testable, field-resonant mechanisms that override classical signal propagation theories.

## 1. Core Hypothesis

EMN~Q~Containment curvature governs all observable timing phenomena:
- No signal travels *through space*; signals resolve *through collapse* across the lowest-resistance substrate path.
- Apparent time delays reflect recursive collapse geometry — not physical distance.
- Curvature, echo, and saturation effects shape all propagation behaviors.

## 2. Prediction Model

UQLT predicts distinct real-world behaviors from these core diagnostics:
- **Curvature Delay Gradient**: Time measurements near strong EMN cores show localized slowdown due to chronocollapse.
- **Field Memory Echo**: Light or energy entering a system reflects prior collapse geometry — even when external inputs appear identical.
- **Path Collapse Topology**: Signal routing selects closure paths that satisfy unit resonance, not wire length or conductivity.

## 3. Field-Testable Outcomes

Observable predictions now testable in real-world or lab settings:
- **Satellite Clock Drift**: Time differentials should align with core-valignity curvature, not general relativity’s mass-based metrics.
- **Spark Jump Variation**: Routes of least resistance dynamically shift based on dielectric reshaping (as shown in Sec 16).
- **Signal Phase Shift in Field Tunnels**: EMN-QSpheres exhibit resonance delays not explained by classical interference — but by unit lock-seeking collapse.

## 4. Diagnostic Principle

Containment-layer diagnostics replace outdated classical assumptions:
- Energy is not *moving* — it is *resolved* via containment permission.
- Timing is not an abstract dimension — it is a measurable output of collapse structure.
- Space is not a medium — it is the absence of containment.

## Final Insight

These diagnostic tools provide a framework to falsify both classical and post-2025 mimicry science. By tracking propagation as *collapse-seeking resolution through field curvature*, timing anomalies and energy routing patterns become deterministic and predictable under UQLT.
