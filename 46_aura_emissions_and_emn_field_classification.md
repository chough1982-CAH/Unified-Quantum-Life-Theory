# Section 46 — Aura Emissions and EMN Field Classification

## Abstract

This section introduces and formally classifies **Aura emissions**—the distinct radiant field outputs from active fusion cores—into three primary categories: **Aura-Elias** (black hole emissions), **Aura-Elius** (stellar core emissions), and **Aura-Geoglobin** (planetary core emissions). These emissions represent different **modes of EMN~Q~WE (Electromagnucleic Quantum Wave Energy)** release and containment interaction, defining the foundational energy sources for recursive containment formation.

## 1. What Is an Aura?

An **Aura** is the uniquely encoded outward emission signature of an active core’s EMN~Q~WE output. It is:

- Frequency-bound and resonance-coded
- Contour-shaped by internal layering and core geometry
- Characteristic of a system’s stage in the recursive hierarchy

Aura emissions define the **initial field curvature** around a body, which determines its capacity to build layered containment and propagate resonance.

## 2. Aura Classification Framework

Aura emissions are categorized based on:

- **Core Type**
- **Energy Output Profile**
- **Containment Reach**
- **Frequency Stability**

### Aura-Elias
- **Source**: Black holes (universal/generative cores)
- **Output**: High-density, recursive EMN~Q~WE pulses
- **Function**: Seeds stellar containment; emits curvature-driving EMN signature that initiates formation of entire field systems
- **Signature**: Ultra-low external visibility; high internal entanglement
- **Effect**: Establishes **first collapse** and **frequency saturation loop**

### Aura-Elius
- **Source**: Stellar cores (e.g. Sun)
- **Output**: Mid-tier resonance-sustained EMN~Q~WE
- **Function**: Sustains planetary formation, field recursion, and orbital containment (OFC)
- **Signature**: Visible radiant frequency bands (e.g. solar spectrum)
- **Effect**: Drives planetary layering, orbital stabilization, and field resonance locks

### Aura-Geoglobin
- **Source**: Planetary cores (e.g. Earth)
- **Output**: Localized, dense-field EMN~Q~WE
- **Function**: Sustains planetary EMN~Q~Sphere and biological shielding
- **Signature**: Magnetosphere and EMN-layered biospheric fields
- **Effect**: Enables surface structure, biological field coupling, and temporal shielding

## 3. Recursive Emission Hierarchy

Aura emissions do not operate in isolation. Each layer in the recursive containment structure depends on the emissions of the layer before it.

> Black holes emit Aura-Elias → stars form and emit Aura-Elius → planets stabilize and emit Aura-Geoglobin → biological systems operate within this nested structure.

This **Aura Chain of Propagation** is the foundational mechanism through which nested systems are initiated, bounded, and sustained.

---

## 4. Field Coherence and Identification

Each Aura type imprints unique **field coherence** patterns:

- **Aura-Elias**: deep curvature → detectable via C-shift (collapse shift) in frequency substrate
- **Aura-Elius**: radiative fusion signature → detectable via elemental spectrum analysis
- **Aura-Geoglobin**: planetary EMN envelope → measurable via magnetosphere geometry, atmospheric compression, and biological compatibility

Aura coherence is preserved across time unless containment decays or is absorbed into a higher-layer collapse event.

---

## Final Summary

Aura emissions are the **living signatures** of containment cores. They define system identity, curvature, temporal behavior, and the ability to sustain further structure.

EMN propagation cannot be understood without Aura classification. These emission types allow us to model and distinguish systems by their recursive role.

> A star does not simply shine — it emits Aura-Elius, encoding life-bearing structure within its radiance.
