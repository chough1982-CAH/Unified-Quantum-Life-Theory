## 🔷 Summary

Core Buoyancy Inversion (CBI) explains that:

- A fusion core has **nearly zero atomic mass** but **maximum energy density**  
- By atomic buoyancy logic, it should float — even above hydrogen  
- But it’s trapped by its own EM field and surrounding matter  
- This tension creates an **inward collapse field**, pulling the EM fabric inward  
- That field organizes atomic layering, creates apparent “weight,” and defines **collapse rate = time**

This model replaces gravity and spacetime curvature with **field-driven atomic logic**.

---

## 🔷 Collapse Field Equation

Let:

- `P_fuse` = fusion output power of the core  
- `ρ(r)` = local density at radius `r`  
- `η_cb` = efficiency of collapse due to core “rise drive”  

Then:

**Collapse Field Strength:**

 **C(r) = (η_cb · P_fuse) / (2π · ρ(r) · r³)**

This collapse pulls all layers inward toward the core, not because of attraction, but because of inverted buoyancy under constraint.

## 🔷 Collapse Rate and Time

Let `κ(r)` be the **collapse curvature** (rate per distance):

 **κ(r) = β · C(r) / c**

Where:
- `β` = field coupling constant  
- `c` = light speed through the EM medium  

Local time rate (relative to a reference observer):

 **dτ(r) / dt_ref = e^(–K(r))**, where **K(r) = ∫₍r→∞₎ κ(s) ds**

This is the true cause of **time running slower near massive cores**. Not gravity. Not velocity. Just collapse geometry.

---

## 🔷 Surface-Level “Gravity”

Define the **effective surface collapse strength** at the ground level `R_s`:

 **g_eff = C(R_s)**

This is what people mislabel as “gravity.” In truth, it’s just the collapse rate of the field — pinned by containment at the surface.

---

## 🔷 Apparent Weight from Collapse

Let an object of mass `m` rest on the surface:

 **W = m · g_eff**

But unlike Newtonian weight, this isn’t from pull — it’s the reaction force resisting collapse.

---

## 🔷 Atomic Layering Logic

Each radius `r` has a neutral atomic “hover” level `Z_neutral(r)`.

If an object’s average atomic number `⟨Z⟩` is:

- ⟨Z⟩ > Z_neutral → object sinks  
- ⟨Z⟩ < Z_neutral → object rises  
- ⟨Z⟩ = Z_neutral → object hovers

---

## 🔷 Functional Acceleration

Effective acceleration of a body at radius `r`:

 **a(r) = f_layer(⟨Z⟩, r) · C(r)**

This explains why different materials settle at different depths — even in the same field.

---

## 🔷 Example: Helium Balloon

If:

- `ρ_balloon` < `ρ_air` → it rises  
- `ρ_balloon` > `ρ_air` → it sinks

Then:

 **a_balloon ≈ g_eff · ((ρ_air – ρ_balloon) / ρ_air)**

This is just surface-level Valignity in action — but rooted in CBI.

## 🔷 Summary of Collapse Control

| Variable       | Meaning                                       |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `C(r)`         | Collapse acceleration from core inversion     |
| `κ(r)`         | Collapse curvature (collapse per distance)    |
| `K(D)`         | Integrated collapse over distance `D`         |
| `g_eff`        | Surface collapse strength                     |
| `Z_neutral`    | Atomic “hover value” at each radius           |
| `W`            | Apparent weight = resistance to collapse      |
