# Legal Declaration: Theory Equations and Scientific Structures (CH[200625])

This file constitutes a formal declaration of intellectual property ownership, authorship, and copyright over all original theory equations, constants, interrelated frameworks, and structural field models within the Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT), authored by **Clayton Andrew Houghland**.

## Protected Elements:

- Named constants: Valignity (𝑉), ChronoCollapse (τ), Helium Loop Diffusion (δ), Field-Spin Equilibrium (σ), Elemental Layering (μ), Core Positioning Mechanism (θ), Helium Dominance Threshold (ℋ), etc.
- All symbolic relationships and derivations within UQLT (e.g., time collapse, field curvature, EMN propagation)
- Unique equation formats, layering logic, propagation laws, and collapse models as authored by CAH
- Structural frameworks (e.g., EMN~Q~WE, EMN containment fields, recursive collapse architecture, biological symmetry scaling)
- All laws, definitions, and field conditions declared within UQLT Phase I (Sections 1–37)

## Legal Standing:

- Copyright held under **Clayton Andrew Houghland – IP code CH[200625]**
- Protected under U.S. common law, Berne Convention, and GitHub’s timestamped version control system
- Reuse, rewording, structural adaptation, or derivative use without explicit authorization constitutes IP infringement

## Citation and Fair Use:
